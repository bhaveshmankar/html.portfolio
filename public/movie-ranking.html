<h3>Malaal</h3>
<p>Light-hearted romantic movie.Just liked bcoz of the love story between Marathi Manus and Tripathi.</p>
<h3>3-Idiots</h3>
<p>Padhai theoretical nahi practical hai.Signifies what what engineer can do?</p>
<h3>Jawan</h3>
<p>Somewhat similar to what i want to do to uplift someone.Kuch alag tarike se.</p>
